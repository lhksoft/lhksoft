- 👋 Hi, I’m @lhksoft
- 👀 I’m interested in GUI development, specialised using databases
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linux/development - it managed me through wxWidgets and some low-level gtk3 code (don't understand anything of gtk though)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects like wxWidgets, in my latest contribution to git I've code some custom controls.
- 📫 How to reach me .. find me 

- Must say, I was a 'professional' amature in MFC coding. Wend to wxWidgets because that API looks most like MFC. But mfc is only for win32, and linux is more stable, faster, robust so was forced to leave the win32 world and try wxWidgets, because C++ is the only language I'm specialised in. C too complex, and it's been too long I've coded in Pascal. Basic is too much 'basic' (it's actualy a language to learn coding if you don't totaly nothing about programming languages).
- For developping for linux, I was forced to learn someting about CMake, but cmake still looks too complex too me. I still don't understand how to build custom static/dynamic library's. Making the program (MovieCatalog) too complex.. Any help with that would be welcome.
